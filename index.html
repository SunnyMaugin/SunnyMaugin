            <h2>Pathfinding visualizer</h2>
            <p>This is a pathfinding visualizer that I made in Python which allows us to see how the A* algortithm works visually. I found
              this project really fun as it was something I wanted to do for a while as I find sorting and pathfinding algorithms interesting
              on how they all use different methods to get to their goal. It was also my first time implementing pygame into one of my projects 
              so it was fun learning how to use it.

            <p>A full Python terminal game that tests you word per minute(WPM) by giving you a random sentence to type out. This project was a fun little
              project I decided to do because I love to be competitive so an idea of a speed-writing game intrigued me.

            <h1>Cyber Security Challenge</h1>
            <h2>London Competition</h2>
            <p>During my last year of college I had a passion and interest in cyber security so I did some research and found a Cyber Security 
              Challenge in London and I entered and had to do multiple different tasks to earn points on the leaderboard, the chalenges lasted 
              around a week before it closed, specific challenges I worked on and completed were Secure Development and Coding and Vunrability assessment.
              I ended up at 5th place on the leaderboards and was very excited because I was then invited to the 2019 qualifiers, however didn't attend due to 
              my exams and I had found another passion which was python.

          has led me into wanting to be a software engineer.

          <h2>Bank of America</h2>
          <p>We had a visit to Bank of America and it was an opportunity to see how a company like them operates daily, we were shown their workspace
             and how they manage their teams in sections. After the visit, we worked with Bank of America who hosted the project which was to take a huge
              amount of data about London and find a certain niche and link it to crime. I was chosen to be the Data analyst for the team and I learned
               how to use pandas to find and organise data. This was great to get me out my comfort zone and work in a team.</p>

          <h2>Wordplay Fintech Hackathon</h2>
          <p>One of the first major hackathons I attended was one of the most eye-opening hackathons I had, I learned, enjoyed and networked
             with a lot of amazing people. However, with the group I was in we did not manage to win with our application idea, however, it was
              a great opportunity to network with people in industries and get a sneak peek of how it's like to make a start-up. </p>

          <h2>Mozilla Festival(Mozfest)</h2>
          <p>Over the years I have been interested in attending events, which led me to find mozfest and since then I have attended 3 Mozfest events
             so far and hoping to attend more. Mozfest was a great opportunity for me to find out a lot about a variety of different tech and how it 
             works. Also, mozfest is a great place to network with people of your interest. </p>

          <h2>Google Event</h2>
          <p>Google had set up events to allow young people to come and visit Google HQ and meet a lot of other companies,
             talk about what they do, what their interview process is like and what they do as a company. This was great for me so that I can see what
            I was interested in and what I might pursue as a career.</p>
